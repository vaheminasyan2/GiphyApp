# GiphyApp
This app desinged to show 10 random gifs on given topic pulled using GIPHY API. Within the main topic user can choose diffrent subtopics clicking on buttons on the top of the screen.

We choose Sports as our main topic. User can also add a subtopic by entering a sport name into the search field. After submitting a new sport name, new button will be added to the current list of buttons with user's sport name. Then user can click on it to see 10 random gifs.

By default all the gifs will be rendered as still images. By clicking on each image it will play/pause gif.

Under each gif we display its rating (PG, G so on).
